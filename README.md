For an example image of a UAV aerial photo block, the parameters of the inner and outer orientation as well as the coordinates of signaled points are given.
1. Calculate of the projection matrix P with the given inner and outer orientation. And plot the corresponding points in the image.
2. Determin the P matrix with the image coordinates in 1.section and the given coordiantes.
3. Reconstruction of the inner and outer orientation using the P matrix.
